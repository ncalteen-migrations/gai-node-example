GitHub is an Agile/DevOps environment, and builds GitHub on GitHub, following the “GitHub Flow”, published here : https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/.

Multiple guidelines and instructional documents cover every aspect of our development process, but we do not disclose them. GitHub’s internal procedures are restricted to internal use only under our Data Classification standard.
